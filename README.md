# Thomas's OC Programs

Temporary Measure: if you wish to use my programs you will need to add them locally to oppm on each computer:
With an internet card run:
```
cd /etc
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ThomasRules2000/ThomasOCPrograms/master/oppm.cfg
cd /home
```
and then use oppm as usual

This is a repo of all my OC programs, using code from various sources.

There is no copyright on this work (all the code which was not written by me is in the public domain, on forums etc.)

Many Thanks to Figlet Fonts and misc people on the internet who I forgot to write down for the assets in this repo I did not write
